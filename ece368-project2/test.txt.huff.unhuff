Hello,

 

Please submit your ADP or the revised one if you were required to resubmit it so that you can schedule a registration meeting for this week or so that I can send you your PIN before your time ticket opens.  Juniors are required to schedule their registration meeting by Oct. 24 th if they want one.  After Oct. 24th I can still send you your PIN once your ADP is submitted and is satisfactory. Then you will be able to schedule when your time ticket opens up, you will just have to schedule a registration meeting starting Nov. 17th.
